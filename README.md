These files presenets the output of the first layer of our simulator, which produces multiple JSON files.\
Each file contains various information such as the positions (e.g., the coordinate and tile number) and size of the machine, the position of the UE, the BLER values for a given position of one UE and one gNodeB according to the different positions of the machine in its path, the Line of Sight (LOS) condition (whether, for a machine location in its path, there is a LOS path between the UE and the selected gNodeB or not), the T-R distance, and the size of the factory area.
